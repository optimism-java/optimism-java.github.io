Optimism Java is a organization which contribute public goods to help the Ethereum and Optimism community get better and better.

This documentation repository is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and the site
itself is published at [`optimism-java.github.io`](https://optimism-java.github.io/).

See [more](https://docs-template.consensys.net/) information about how Consensys uses Docusaurus.

Take a look at some [good first issues](https://github.com/optimism-java/optimism-java.github.io?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
to get started.

### How to submit a suggestion or change

The best way to suggest a change to these docs is through a process known as a **pull request**.
If you're not familiar with how that works, check out [GitHub's guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

If you do intend to submit a pull request, please open an issue first, and [link to it in your pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). **This is particularly important if you are an ecosystem contributor** â€” submitting your details in an issue first will make it much easier for our docs team to process your
contributions.



If you are familiar with making a pull request, we **highly recommend that you run a version of these docs locally, and preview your changes locally, before submitting them**.
In fact, it's part of the PR process.

View the [Consensys doc contribution guidelines](https://docs-template.consensys.net/) for
information on how to:

- [Submit a contribution](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/submit-a-contribution) using forks and pull requests.
- Consult the [documentation style guide](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/style-guide).
- [Format your Markdown](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/format-markdown) correctly.
- [Preview the docs](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/preview) locally.

## Running locally

You will need to have **Node.js** installed to run the live previews of the docs locally.

It is highly recommended that you use a tool like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
to manage Node.js versions on your machine.

### Installing recommended Node.js version with `nvm`

1. Follow the above instructions to install `nvm` on your machine, or go [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
2. Go to root folder of this project in your terminal.
3. Run `nvm install` followed by `nvm use`. This will install the version specified by this project in the `.nvmrc` file.

### Running this project

1. Navigate to root folder of the project after installing Node.js
2. Run the following in sequence, which only needs to be done once:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run prepare
   ```

3. To preview and for every time afterwards:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Build

    $ npm run build

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static
contents hosting service.

### Adding new words to the dictionary

This repository includes a _linter_, which you can think of as a spell-check that also checks code
formatting and standards, and a lot more. It's possible that you will use a word in your content
that is not known to the linter, and your build, or commit, will fail.

You can run the linter any time with the command `npm run lint`.

If the linter finds a word that it doesn't recognize, take a look at `project-words.txt` in the root
directory; if the word that the linter caught is correctly spelled, and you wish it to pass the
linter's test, add it to `project-words.txt`, save, add and commit those changes, and see if it
passes.

For tidiness, please ensure you adhere to the alphabetical order established in `project-words.txt`.
